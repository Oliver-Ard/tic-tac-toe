#### What I have practiced in this project?

The main focus was on using the `factory functions` and the `IIFE` module patern to structure the code. This way the code is much more clean and organized.

The hardest part of the project was that I had to separate the game logic from the interaction with the DOM. So I made the game work in the console first, then added the DOM interaction.
